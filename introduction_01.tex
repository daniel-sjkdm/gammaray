\section{Introduction}

Natural language processing (nlp) is a field of artifial intelligence that studies the
how a computer can be given the ability to understand and generate written and spoken
human language. It's a field that appeared in the xx with very basic algorithms based
on processing raw characters via regular expressions and rule based based systems and 
nowadays it has evolved and been improved thanks to deep learning research and state
of the art neural network architectures (see GPT3). 

To understand what's in the core of nlp systems we should take a journey back in time
where.

A core concept in the nlp literature is the language model.
